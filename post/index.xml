      <description>The goal was to predict whether or not an individual is likely to have diabetes based on the features body mass index (BMI) and age (in years). Therefore, it is a binary classification problem. A target value of 0 indicates that the individual does not have diabetes, while a value of 1 indicates that the individual does have diabetes.
Data was collected in excel sheets and loaded as a pandas dataframe.</description>

      <description>Note:
Scikit learn requires numeric data and no missing values. Real world data often has missing values so we will preprocess data often eg you recieve a color as your data, this makes it categorica and as scikit learn will not accept categorical, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to convert it to numerical. You can create binary features from the categories, this is abinary preprocession called Dummy Variables. Binary features from a list of music genres To create dummy variables, we can use scikit-learn: OneHotEncoder or pandas: get_dummies()</description>
